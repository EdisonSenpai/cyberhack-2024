# Cyber Hack - Innovation Labs

A 24 hours contest where me and my team CyberNova made an application for Advancing Services with Digital Identity Wallets using Android Studio for interface and a server for backend in Flask with a data base in Sqlite.
The app was made to innovate the fidelity card wallets by making them more secure and we also simulated the usage of the digital wallet.
